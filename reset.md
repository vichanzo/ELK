I installed elasticsearch kibana and metricbeats locally and forgot my passwords.  Now What?

Step 1 - Reset Elastic password
```
cd /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin
./elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic
# Reference https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/reset-password.html
```

No good - got this output:
```
root@cc-pve-5070:/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin# ./elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic
This tool will reset the password of the [elastic] user to an autogenerated value.
The password will be printed in the console.
Please confirm that you would like to continue [y/N]y

Failed to determine the health of the cluster. Cluster health is currently RED.
This means that some cluster data is unavailable and your cluster is not fully functional.
The cluster logs (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/8.7/logging.html) might contain information/indications for the underlying cause
It is recommended that you resolve the issues with your cluster before continuing
It is very likely that the command will fail when run against an unhealthy cluster.

If you still want to attempt to execute this command against an unhealthy cluster, you can pass the `-f` parameter.
